"9","participant 9",4,"She is thoughtful as many people (me too) are, about the situation and what the other may think about her.

She seems fun for what I have seen so far.",5,"I still empathize a lot here, it has happened to me before (I think it is impossible to be always serious and wise even for adults). A lot of times I laugh about something or somebody but not because I want to hurt them, just because I cannot control it. By the way I even laugh about myself when I do something embarrassing or when I look strange.",3,"Very strange situation, I think the guy was too dramatic by the way.",3,"She expected something that he probably will not give her (fun situation).&nbsp;",2,"I cannot empathize very much since I would have behaved very differently (it has never happened to me and I would have reacted differently in the job interview). She seems to lack any sort of filters, but I still find some traits of her personality understandable.",1,"I cannot empathize here (different life experiences), so I cannot fully understand what she means deeply.",5,"Here I do empathize a lot with the sister of the protagonist, since I too have a sister that used to steal my clothes, and I did take it seriously, very seriously to the point she started hiding them to not face discussions. I recovered them by periodically searching them in her closet.",4,"Instead of the protagonist, here I still empathize with the sister.",1,"I think here she just obliged herself to do something she did not want from the beginning; she thus ended up being angry hurting him while she should have rejected him from the start (bus).

"10","participant 10",1,"I' do not really feel anything at the moment, I am just a little bit confused by these list of questions adressed towards me&nbsp;",1,"I' m still feeling nothing honestly&nbsp;",2,"I agree that is a sort of embarassing situation but what i do not understand is all this dislike towards a man that has done nothing bad&nbsp;",2,"If before I felt somewhat sorry for her, now I feel aversion for her words and behaviour&nbsp;",1,"I dislike her even more due to the way she moked the affacionated way in which her ex-boyfriend treated her and her relatives&nbsp;",3,"I feel a bit sorry for her in the situation with loan and the jealousy towards her sister, but I don't know why I just can totally feel sorry for her; maybe because of her beahaviour before this or because with a little bit more attention the accident with the loaner could have been avoided&nbsp;",3,"I feel sorry for her to some extent, but again she is not the only one growing up wihtouth a parent. She should also understand how difficult it propably was for his father to look after two children on his own, how he also has problems and how if he doesn't call she has a phone with his number too",5,"This is the piece of conversation that sparks more empathy for me, it is a very relatable situation because I have a little sister that wears my clothes without asking all the time and always lies about where my clothes went when I search for them&nbsp;",3,"I feel sorry for the inferiority complex towards her sister, but in the end is her sister and I don't see anything strange in asking her for help, so I do not really get all this pride-conservation attitude&nbsp;",1,"I am not really able to feel empathy for this charachter, I do not really understand what she is thinking about or better why she thinks like that and behave like that ( like calling someone pathetic just because doesn't wanto to have only sex with her but trying also to know her better.)&nbsp;",2,"She acts like a human being, helping someone, but I'm still thinking about the way she treated the guy a few moments ago and I cannot feel empathy for her",3,"I feel a little bit sorry that the other woman was so drunk that misunderstood her intentions&nbsp;",3,"I feel sorry for this sort of existential crisis she seems to be dealing with at the moment, but at the same time I really don't totally get this way of acting, maybe beacuse I' ve never felt the need or seen the utility to resolve unsolved situation with a fundamental figure like a father at 2 a.m and drunk. At this point, I think that I just do not really like this charachter&nbsp;",3,"I feel the akwardness between the 2, but again, I would have respected the request of the father and avoided the situation. I don't get get all of this need for useless drama&nbsp;&nbsp;",3,"Again I feel sorry for this weird situation with the stepmother, but she could have easely avoided it&nbsp;",5,"Something in the way she describes the loss of her bestfriend really hits me hard"
"11","participant 11",1,"I'm a little bit confused by her behavior. Especially the final question confused me even more, thinking back to what she said at the beginning of the scene",2,"What I thought was ""And now?""",2,"It is clear that she has found herself in a situation that she does not like very much, but anyway she is behaving politely.&nbsp;I can partly understand the feeling she feels.&nbsp;",1,"I still feel a little confused.&nbsp;",1,"I can't get in her shoes because (when she looks at us) she reacts in a strange way. She seems happy and satisfied when he he said ""And I'll be sure to treat you like a nasty little bitch"" and that asthonishes me a lot.&nbsp;",1,"I don't know if she feels admiration or if there's a little jealousy in what she says.",4,"This is the first time I can feel empathy for her. I feel sorry for her because we can imagine that she had a difficult life after the death of her mother and the ""abandonment"" of her father.&nbsp;",2,"I understand what she's feeling because I also have a sister and wearing secretly something of her is a common thing (but I think it happens more when you're a child).&nbsp;",3,"On the one hand I feel empathy towards her because I think she feels inferior to her sister.&nbsp;I also perceive her difficulty in having to admit that she has economic problems.&nbsp;",1,"With that look she seemed happy because what she wanted was to take that money bu I'm really confused.&nbsp;",1,"I'm confused. Why didn't she tell her that she's a woman? (we understand it in part just in the scene after)",2,"I don't know what she's doing. His behavior confuses me. She seems&nbsp; a very strange girl with extreme need of someone.&nbsp;",3,"As strange as she is, I'm very sorry to see her so insecure in this scene.&nbsp; I'm sorry that she has so many problems with herself.&nbsp;I perceive resentment in her words.&nbsp;",1,"I don't feel empathy because I don't undestand what she's doing and what she's going to do.",2,"I'm a little sorry for what the godmother tells her.",1,"I don't feel the slighest regret that her friend is dead.&nbsp;"
"12","participant 12",1,"I don't really have comments on that, she is quite hilarious.",3,"I can understand her awkwardness when she saw someone looking at her on the bus.",1,"I don't know why she said that actually. Probably because she is letting him talk even if she's not interested.",3,"She knows him and probably it has already happened and he came back anyway. She is quite confident.",3,"Really awkward and rude, i can understand why she flinched.",3,"We all make these kind of comments in our head all the time, quite realistic.",5,"I can see a hint of sadness and disappointment in her face, it was probably hard for her and her sister.",5,"Really funny, it happens a lot between sisters.",4,"She is probably trying to not be a burden to her sister even though i can see she's struggling in her life.",2,"I don't know what to think about this scene. He is a kinda strange guy but really honest at the end, and she stole from him, i think it's not right even though you have financial problems.",1,"Funny but she's indifferent.",2,"I understand she having a really hard time and she needs help.",4,"I mean, she's totally right.",5,"Obnoxious.",1,"Fake. She's not even trying to be good to her.",4,"She doesn't want to show too much what she's feeling but i think she's suffering a lot for the loss of her friend."
"13","participant 13",1,"it feels like she feels completely at ease sharing such details, as if she was talking to a really close friends, but I dont' feel at ease and so far I do not feel empathy towards her&nbsp;",1,"So far I do not understand what is going on&nbsp;",2,"I kind of understand the fact of being in a conversation that you would have preferred it hadn't started, but actually she was the first one looking at the guy and smiling at him.&nbsp;",1,"I don't like her behaviour/attitude",1,"I don't get why she gave him her number, since when he started talking to her she said ""I hate myself"". Moreover, I interpret ""And I'll be sure to treat you like a nasty little bitch"" as a huge lack of respect",1,"She judges her sister but at the same time I think she is slightly jealous of her&nbsp;",2,"Sorry to know that, it is clear that she had suffered and that she is still suffering; but still, I do not like her attitude",3,"Sometimes this happens to me with my sister too",3,"I feel sorry to see that it is so difficult for her to ask a favour to her sister",1,"She is in trouble and she needs money, but she is taking advantage of him, stealing his money and I don't find it good in any case",3,"I feel sorry to see that she is really sad&nbsp;",3,"I feel sorry for her because she must be tremendously sad and alone",3,"I feel sorry for her, because it is clear that she has never liked her stepmother; even though she says she is not evil, she does not like to see her with her father&nbsp;",3,"I am sorry to see that her stepmother, even though she calls her ""darling"", does not like her too and she even makes a snide remark",4,"This situation with her stepmother makes me feel sad for her",4,"Even though she tries to be ironic and to smile, she feels terribly sad and alone. I feel sorry for her"
"14","participant 14",4,"I can definitely relate t her story, even if some bits I haven't actually experienced myself. The fact that she looks into the camera to say certain lines really makes me feel like I'm stepping into her shoes.",3,"This time I feel she's looking at me with a sense of challenge or laughter, like if she's wondering ""You know what happens know, don't you?"".",4,"This situation and her last line make this scene very relatable, I wanted to tell her something like ""You and me both"".&nbsp;",3,"This whole scene is very funny, but this time I wanted to tell her ""don't do this him, he's already messed up as is"".",4,"I got really excited for her, but I feel like she might ruin this chance.",3,"The scene at the bank made me feel sorry for her, the last two lines made me roll my eyes. I understand where she's coming from but I don't really connect to her situation.&nbsp;",4,"I immediately don't like her father, even though I haven't met him.&nbsp;",5,"This is the moment I probably related to the most in the whole episodes.",5,"I'm right there with her. I get it.",3,"Again, I can't relate completely, but I understand why she acts the way she acts.",4,"It feels weird to see someone, that so far has acted poorly towards other people, do something kind.&nbsp;",4,"I feel her pain in having to go back on a promise she made with her friend.",4,"I 100% believe her. No proof needed.&nbsp;",5,"I totally relate: everyone has a relative that is exactly like this stepmother.&nbsp;",5,"At this point I'm happy she stole the statue, the stepmother deserves it.&nbsp;",5,"Yeah, I really feel for her. It must suck to go through this alone."
"15","participant 15",2,"Such question does not convey empathy and it appears rather forced",3,"The level of empathy is now higher since the spectator starts feeling involved and he/she is looking forward to knowing what it going to happen",4,"The protagonist's intervention makes us understand that she does not feel at ease in this situation&nbsp;",3,"The level of empathy still remains quite high",3,"We perceive the protagonist's embarrassment&nbsp;",1,"The protagonist's attitude is quite mean&nbsp;",5,"The level of empathy rises since emotions linked to personal experience are involved&nbsp;",4,"The spectator is still involved, due to the continuous direct interventions on the part of the protagonist",5,"The spectator is fully involved now: the protagonist speaks directly to him/her, explicitly trying to establish a dialogue&nbsp;",1,"Again, the protagonist appears arguably selfish&nbsp;",4,"The protagonist, moved by her emotions, behaves kindly: therefore, also the level of empathy gets higher",2,"The level of empathy falls: this happens also because we shift from one scene to another, without a clear logic link&nbsp;",2,"Again, the protagonist is quite mean",3,"We perceive the protagonist's embarrassment",3,"The protagonist's direct glance into the camera is sufficient so as to create an empathic connection with the spectator",4,"The level of empathy with the protagonist increases again: unexpectedly, we get to know a dramatic story related to the protagonist's tragic past. Consequently, emotions are more intense."
"16","participant 16",3,"I don't have any advice here",3,"she appears to be unsatisfied by her life, she doesn't really control it and it's not ok&nbsp;",3,"she's got an unhealthy way to approach people: she doesn't like him but she is lead by an inner perverse instict to interact wth him",2,"as i said before she doesn't care f people but she can't stay alone so she uses people",2,"she cannot approache people, she lies&nbsp;",3,"here seems that her life is collapsing, she definitely doesn't have control",3,"family issues",3,"cleptomany",2,"nothing to add",2,"maybe she's trying to overcome her family issues by using menshe fails in what she does or to me it appears so",3,"she is protective with this woman&nbsp;",3,"great friendship",3,"family issues she doesn't have a relationship with the father&nbsp;",3,"the stepmother isn't a good one the father cut the protagonist out while crating a new family",3,"as in the previous answer",4,"sad story, all the previous behaviours appear to be an attempt to overcome the death of her friend&nbsp;&nbsp;"
"17","participant 17",1,"eehm.. I don't know and I seriously don't want to know...",2,"ugh.. why do weird guys always make eye contact on the bus?",3,"why are you still smiling and talking to him? Just send him away!",2,"don't you feel bad for him?",2,"what is wrong with you? why would you be disappointed that he said it was a joke?",1,"I seriously don't understand what is going on with you",3,"that must have been hard for you&nbsp;",3,"I guess that's something that happens between sisters",4,"I know it's hard to ask for help, but if you were more sincere maybe she'd help you out&nbsp;",4,"I get why you left and I get that you're broke, but you shouldn't steal other people's money&nbsp;",4,"it must be really hard for you&nbsp;",3,"your thoughts and actions don't match up, but you finally decided to ask for help",4,"I'm sorry that you finally opened up and your dad was unmoved.. but why take it out on your stepmother?",3,"what now?",4,"I get what you meant before now..",5,"oh god.."
"18","participant 18",4,"This is not the point. The right question is why do you think this guy has never found someone he could do it with, except you?",3,"Would you please stop staring at him?",4,"I think you're very stupid, you brought this on yourself.",3,"yes, I agree with you",5,"ok, now we really have a problem&nbsp;",4,"oh, yes in fact she seems pretty nice to me",5,"I'm so sorry for you. It shouldn't have been easy for you two&nbsp;",5,"Ok then just keep it hidden under&nbsp; your coat and don't let her see it",5,"Come on! you need those money and you have to ask her!",2,"Are you ok? What's the problem with you? Why are you behaving like this?",2,"I don't think that's a compliment though.",2,"just don't think about it",3,"Do you really think so? well, loving stepmothers is not so easy though",5,"Apparently she doesn't seem so unpleasant, but now you are scaring me",4,"ok, yes now I must confess that you were right about her",1,"you shouldn't be laughing like this&nbsp;"
"19","participant 19",5,"You should not think too much about these kinds of situation but just live them, at the end you made me laugh, really.&nbsp;",3,"I feel embarrassed like if I were in your shoes",5,"I still feel the same kind of embarrassment&nbsp;",4,"You are making me laugh.&nbsp;",4,"Why do you always watch me? Am I your point of reference?",5,"You're quite unlucky&nbsp;",5,"I feel pity for your situation but you make me laugh at the same time.&nbsp;",5,"You are amazing",5,"I feel exactly the same in many, many situations",4,"You are wonderful",4,"What are you thinking about?",2,"You puzzle me.",5,"You are keeping puzzling me&nbsp;",3,"I feel you",3,"I feel pity for you",5,"I love your way of behaving and expressing things, thanks for establishing this connection by looking at me&nbsp;"
"20","participant 20",2,"Yes, you probably do.&nbsp;",2,"I can perceive her disgust towards that man.&nbsp;",2,"If I were you, I would go away.&nbsp;",2,"She seems to confident.",3,"That man is really embarrassing.",2,"She's probably envious of her sister",3,"In this scene I can perceive her resignation.&nbsp;",1,"Hide it because she may notice it.",1,"You can't do it because you're coward.&nbsp;",2,"She's a silly girl, she's mocking the boy and stealing his money.

You should pay more attention to avoid such situations.",5,"I can perfectly understand that feeling. Sometimes it is really hard to find the courage to ask tough questions.",1,"This is not something I would do.&nbsp;",4,"I feel pity towards her too. You are doing the right thing now.",4,"Sometimes we do need help and have to ask for it. It is comprehensible.",5,"I feel compassion.",4,"Now I understand your opinion about her. I'm anxious for you about the probable escalation.",3,"I feel disappointed about your behaviour but I see the difficult situation.",4,"I really don't feel comfortable with such an irony but I feel pity."
"24","participant 24",5,"I think you're right, people after occasional sex tend to behave oddly.&nbsp;",2,"I think you're judging his teeth",5,"You don't like him, do you?&nbsp;",3,"I'm cringing",5,"I love your facial expressions! They mirror my face.&nbsp;",1,"You're very harsh on your sister.&nbsp;",5,"Funny ahahah",5,"It happens when you have a sister",5,"You're too proud",5,"That was intense!",5,"I would have called an ambulance",5,"Aahahahah very funny",5,"Aahaahah",5,"I already hate your stepmother",5,"Ok I really hate her now",5,"That teaches me to make my own business"
"25","participant 25",2,"I understand how some things that happen to us in life might be predictable and how some things that you've been told get stuck in your head for quite a lot of time, and surely the last statement made me laugh. But apart from that, I wouldn't say I empathize too much with her in these first 3 minutes.&nbsp;",5,"Yes, in this case I fully understand the situation, and makes me laugh mainly because that happens and I know exactly the feeling. So I empathize with her.",4,"Sadly, I empathize with her and I know the feeling of keeping on doing something you don't really want to do and you're aware of it, but you don't stop God knows why.&nbsp;",3,"From the last statement it's understandable that is not the first time that they break up and their relationship is clearly not an healthy one. I never happened to be in her place, but I understand her fear to be alone, even though she acts like she wants to be alone. I do not agree with her behaviour, but I understand that being alone takes some courage and not everybody is ready to be face to face with him/herself.",5,"Totally, my reaction was completely like hers. Even though some of the things people say make you uncomfortable, you just try to play it cool; most of the time it might be because you just have no idea of how to respond to such things.&nbsp;",3,"I really felt her sadness and frustration when she was asked to leave the bank without being given the loan. As far as the comment to the camera is concerned (it is ok to be anorexic since clothes look good on you) I think is quite harsh, but at the same time is very ironic.&nbsp;",4,"I never experienced what she said , but I can feel her anger and disappointment in her ironic tone and in her look.&nbsp;",4,"I do not have a sister to steal the clothes from, but I get the situation and the consequence being a ""tense situation"".",5,"It is really funny to see represented not only this kind of situation but all the thoughts that normally go on in your mind when your proud impedes you to ask someone something, even more when that person knows exactly what your needs are.&nbsp;",2,"I got the glance, it happened to me before to share such glance with a friend for example. Of course, under other circumstances.",4,"Her traits are indeed very androgynous and she's aware of that. Of course, seeing the course of the whole day, it wasn't something nice to hear at that point.&nbsp;",4,"Her sadness struck in and by saying ""fuck it"" I'd say she came at some sort of realization, don't know which one.&nbsp;",3,"With the ""fuck it"" she says in this scene, we see the realization she had before, in particular, I think she wanted some affection, someone to talk to and that could console her, in a sense, empathize with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She of course doesn't like her stepmother very much, who probably is not very likable.&nbsp;",3,"She knows her stepmother and knows that she can be very subtle. I get the feeling of being in a room with someone you don't really like and you're both faking for the sake of well manners.&nbsp;",4,"In her eyes I saw some sort of fear, wondering how is it possible that someone you do not get along with can see how you're doing.&nbsp;",4,"In the end, I perceived all her sadness for her lost friend and for how she died. In fact, in that ""she was such a dick"" I felt a lot of bitterness and resentment.&nbsp;"
"26","participant 26",3,"Let's see where this is going",4,"It's him!",3,"What are you doing?",4,"This last line made me smile.",2,"I don't understand why you're doing it but, again, this scene made me laugh.",5,"This is kind of realistic, this is something we all experience. Especially super talented and beautiful sisters!",3,"This is a great dialogue, and I had guessed you family history since the ""dad"" line.",4,"Laughing again.",5,"I don't blame you, it's super difficoult!",4,"In this I recognise the need of not being alone we have some nights, no matter what.",4,"This is a nice scene, you are not alone because you can be helpful for others.",4,"At least there is someone that understands you (I didn't know she was dead).",4,"What are you trying to obtain there?",3,"I want to see why she is a ""cunt"".",4,"I would have said the same about the ""feminist"" vision suggested by the woman.",4,"Now I see, that sucks."
"27","participant 27",2,"I find her funny, but I cannot relate to the feeling she is talking about.",3,"I can understand her reaction and the scene is funny.",3,"I am sympathizing with her, I find her funny and can understand her point of view.",3,"In the first part of the scene, I can perceive her feeling of unease.&nbsp;Then, moving on, I cannot take her side completely, she looks too satisified when she says ""It will"".&nbsp;",5,"I can perceive her awkwardness.",3,"I can understand her attitude towards her sister.",4,"I feel sorry for her.",5,"I can relate, I have a sister too.",4,"I can see why she is acting like that, I feel sorry for her again.",3,"I can feel she is depressed and angry, even if she is mistreating the guy. I feel sorry for both of them.",4,"I perceive a sense of disillusionment coming from her glance, as if she realized she would never be really understood.",5,"I feel pity for her.",4,"I feel pity for her.",4,"I feel sorry for her, but at the same time I know she can manage the situation.",5,"I feel pity for her, she has just asked for help she won't receive.",5,"I feel extremely sorry for her situation while she is telling the story to the taxi driver, however when she looks at the camera smiling she gives me courage, because she looks tough."
"28","participant 28",4,"I feel like I knew her from a very long time, I feel a kind of affection for her&nbsp;",4,"Funny reaction but very realistic&nbsp;",4,"What she says and how she acts with the stranger is not what she really thinks&nbsp;",4,"She is very funny and credible. Just as if she were a friend of mine.&nbsp;",4,"Strange situation and plausible reaction&nbsp;",4,"She is very stressed out but always ironic and funny.&nbsp;",4,"I feel sorry for her. She is always smiling and trying to diminish the seriousness of her situation but in reality she is suffering a lot.&nbsp;",4,"This happens all the time between sisters, a very credible situation&nbsp;",5,"She is proud and wants to make it on her own",3,"She is being very rude here&nbsp;",4,"Now, on the contrary, she is very sympathetic&nbsp;",5,"She has financial and emotional problems but she do not take things seriously enough.&nbsp;",4,"I do not know this new character yet, but I believe the protagonist is saying the truth when she affirms: ""To be fair, she's not an evil stepmother.She's just a cunt"".&nbsp;",4,"She does not take the reaction of the stepmother seriously and teases her.&nbsp;",4,"I feel pity for the protagonist, I think nobody is really understanding what she needs.&nbsp;",4,"It was objectively dishonest of her to steal the statue, but I can understand her reasons and why she did it and I do not judge her negatively"
"29","participant 29",1,"Honestly I've never had a similar experience so... let's try with the next question.",3,"The situation depicted on the bus is a far more usual and ordinary embarrassing situation I would have avoided",2,"Yeah I know what you mean... perhaps you should better avoid strangers if you don't want to talk to them then",1,"So you are used to turn up at someone else's house drunk in you underwear?",1,"You know what? Do you really want to be treated that way?",3,"I'm really sorry for what happened during the consultation. I honestly believe you when you say it is just a genuine accident, one must give the benefit of doubt",3,"Therefore your childhood wasn't probably the best one with such an example",4,"I know what you mean... sometimes I keep my sister's clothes without telling her",2,"Perhaps try again later, your sister looks stressed and angry now",1,"You have been petty",2,"Now you've been kind to this girl",2,"You're going through difficult times and this makes me sad somehow",3,"I can imagine you would need something else from a father and not these words&nbsp;",2,"You're terrible but I can get your point, you probably can't stand her at all",3,"Your stepmother is quite miserable and petty, I think I an understand why you hate her",3,"I'm sorry for you... your story has been difficult"
"30","participant 30",2,"She is weird, the whole scene was weird.",2,"Still odd situation.",2,"Weird.",1,"Not feeling empathy towards her.",1,"Still thinking she's super weird.",3,"I think she lives strange situations, and the fact she was in a hurry and the man called her slut made me feel some kind of empathy towards her for the first time.",4,"I am sorry for her family situation. She jokes about it, but it is clear that it is something more serious than a joke.&nbsp;",3,"This always happens between me and my sister so I can relate.&nbsp;",4,"She is in tension and I feel nervous for her.",3,"I have to say, the man made me feel uncomfortable, but It's strange that she stole money from him.&nbsp;",4,"The fact that the drunk woman asked her if she was okay and said that she had a sad face made me feel a little bit upset.&nbsp;",3,"She's broke and seems to have no life goals, maybe I like her humour, but I wouldn't want to be in her shoes at all.&nbsp;",5,"I'm sorry that her father wants to call her a cab instead of letting her stay.&nbsp;",4,"Weird situation, but It happened to me to speak with these kinds of people so I can relate.",3,"I feel empathy towards her because I don't like her step mother.",2,"I am sorry for her friend but if I was her, I wouldn't smile in that way talking about my dead friend.&nbsp;"
"31","participant 31",3,"I did not expect this, I laughed. Actually, it was proposed in such a funny way that I did not feel like something wrong was happening (she felt under pressure and did something she did not actually want)",1,"I was quite indifferent in this part",1,"She is amusing. I like her, but I did not have an high empathy level here",2,"I kinda felt bad for him, so I felt less empathy for her and more for him",2,"This part did not actually get me into feeling sympathy for her, I was quite indifferent.",4,"I really felt ""Fremdscham"", which is the term used in German referring to the shame felt for actions done by someone else. Now that I know she is without money, I also feel some kind of pity for her. ",4,"Now I felt pity for her, because of her family situation. I'm actually rooting for her. ",4,"I like her, this made me smile, it is something I could probably do myself, so I feel closer to her.",3,"She's funny, she's very human. She's needing help.",2,"Also here I felt a strong vicarious embarrassment (third-party embarrassment: the feeling of embarrassment from observing the embarrassing actions of another person). Still, that did not cause me to be more empathic towards her.",2,"I did not feel particular empathy here.",1,"I was quite indifferent at this point",5,"Hearing how she talks about herself and that she has low self-esteem and is very self-critical, made me empathize more with her.",2,"She really seems desperate and unlucky.",4,"I think when someone is treated unfairly, or when one gets criticized, as in this case (you look ghastly), I tend to empathize more with him/her. ",5,"Now I really felt pity for her and consequent empathy. She lost a friend of hers, and she still tries to make fun of this. I never empathized with her so much. When we feel bad for people, we feel closer to them. She is clearly suffering."
"32","participant 32",1,"She is free, she can do what she wants but I don’t  like her attitude.&nbsp;",1,"I feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;",2,"In her situation I would neither look at nor talk to the boy.&nbsp;",1,"I repeat: I don't like her. She only cares about herself.&nbsp;",2,"Why does she give the number to such a strange guy? Why does she not answer him badly when he makes a bad joke?&nbsp;",3,"She is really clumsy but the men is equally rude.&nbsp;",2,"It is sad that the two sisters do not have a good bond.",1,"The protagonist is pathetic.&nbsp;",2,"I understand that the situation of the protagonist is difficult and uncomfortable but her behaviour is wrong.&nbsp;",3,"She feels alone and she needs someone.&nbsp;",2,"She feels so alone that she helps this girl but at the end she is still the one who needs help.&nbsp;",4,"She had a really bad day. She needs her best friend.&nbsp;",4,"Her parents are horrible, they have no empathy for their daughter.&nbsp;",1,"The atmosphere is quite strange.&nbsp;",1,"Mother and daughter look alike but do not have an important relationship.&nbsp;",5,"Finally we understand why she acts like that. The protagonist is ironic about her friend's death but in reality she suffers a lot."
